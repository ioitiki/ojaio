                  fund one of our three hunger reduction programs so that we can keep feeding, educating, and supporting our
                  community members. The 3 programs we have are the ONLY senior nutrition program in Portland which is geared to
                  low income seniors, the Power of Produce program geared towards expanding young palates, and Double Up Food Bucks
                  which is aimed to support families and individuals who receive food stamps.

                <h4>
                  What the Senior Nutrition program does is donate $5 to each senior who signs up for our programing and that money can
                  be spent on anything at the market. Our feedback from this program has been overwhelming! Seniors who are low income
                  have reported that this five dollars ends up being spent on fruits, veggies, herbs, and eggs that would typically be
                  too expensive for them to enjoy (strawberries, cherries, peaches, tomatoes, basil, etc.) We also do education about how
                  to prepare nutrient dense meals in less than 5 steps that people can do in both full kitchens but also in kitchenette
                  like spaces available to people who live in assisted living facilities.

                <h4>
                  Power of Produce educates and engages children on how food systems work in our community. They learn about farming, bees,
                  what it means to be local, how salmon migrates to us, how climate change is affecting our earth, and encourages them to
                  eat and try the colors of the rainbow while getting them up and moving to have a well rounded healthy lifestyle. Each day
                  at the market they receive $2 to spend on their own local fruits or veggies. The part that is awesome about this program
                  is that we learned that the things that help kids to have the desire to eat more fruits and veggies are when children grow
                  their own, buy their own, and get to know their own food/produce/farmers/market.

                  Double Up Food Bucks is a program that matches up to $5 in food stamp money. So if a person who is eligible for assistance
                  comes to our market without question we will match whatever money they pull out off of their Oregon Trail card (up to $5)
                  which doubles their spend making the more expensive produce fit into their budgets. It's awesome because people all over
                  the city and surrounding areas come to our market to spend their money because they get to truly fill their carts with
                  organic, local, and nutrient dense foods.

                  and when families miss meals. This seasonal poverty affects 600 million people around the world
